Useful selenium/python snippets

I have been learning selenium/python and decided to condense some of what I learned in the form of code snippets that I hope others will find useful.

Before looking at the code I suggest you read 000_snippets_documentation.pdf and watch the short movie, iterate_the_movie.mp4, all contained in the depository.

Hope you find this useful.

NB:

I do not claim to be an expert. If you are more epxerienced than me I would welcome any critique of what I have done.
